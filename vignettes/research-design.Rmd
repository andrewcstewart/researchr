title: "Research Designs"
---

The research design itself consists simply of an RStudio project and some `yaml` encoded metadata files, as well as RMarkdown files that document the research. 

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
#library(researchr)
library(DiagrammeR)
```



```{r}
mermaid("
graph LR
  DC-->MP
  DC-->ID
  MP-->ED
  ID-->ED
  ID-->MP
  MP-->PT
  ED-->PT
  PT-->DC
")
```



```{r}
mermaid("
graph LR
  DC1-->MP1
  DC1-->MP2
  DC1-->MP3
  MP2-->ED1
  MP3-->ED1
  ID1-->ED1
  ED1-->PT1
  DC2-->MP4
  MP4-->PT2
  PT2-->DC3
  DC3-->ID2
  DC3-->MP4
  ID2-->MP5
  MP5-->ED2
")
```
